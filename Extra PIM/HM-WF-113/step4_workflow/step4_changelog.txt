Trigger: Full Workflow Realization (HM-WF-113)

Architecture Refinement:

Introduced ServiceCoordinator to handle BR-HM-074 (Mess/Security planning).

Added PaymentService to handle BR-HM-073 (Deadlines/Auto-revocation).

Added ViolationHandler to separate disciplinary logic from the main manager.

Entity Updates:

Student updated with isEligibleForExtendedStay (BR-HM-061).

AuthorizationDocument now has verifyAuthenticity() for BR-HM-066.

Final Checks: Confirmed Revoked and Terminated states are reachable via the control classes PaymentService and ViolationHandler respectively.
