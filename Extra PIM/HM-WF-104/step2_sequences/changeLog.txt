Step 2 – Change Log
Workflow: HM-WF-104 – Student Room Change

- Validated end-to-end main flow using a single sequence diagram.
- Confirmed responsibility separation across Boundary, Control, and Entity layers.
- Finalized RoomChangeRequest lifecycle from submission to approval.
- Ensured dual approval (Caretaker + Warden) is explicitly represented.
- Verified room reallocation and occupancy update occur only after approval.
- No new entities introduced; Step 1 domain remains intact.
