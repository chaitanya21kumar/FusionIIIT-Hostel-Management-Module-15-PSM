Trigger: Full Workflow Realization (HM-WF-112)

Architecture Refinement (Controllers):

Split the generic control logic into two distinct classes to better represent the workflow lanes:

BookingController: Handles Student-facing operations (Submit Request, Validate Dates) corresponding to HM-UC-036.

BookingManager: Handles Caretaker-facing operations (Approve, Check-In, Check-Out) corresponding to HM-UC-037.

Entity Refinement:

Student: Added conductHistory attribute. This was identified during the realization of the "Review Student History" step in the workflow (Decision Node D1 logic), which was not explicitly captured in earlier steps.

GuestRoom: Added explicit reserve() and release() operations to map to the system tasks "Reserve Room" and "Release Room" defined in the workflow.

Relationship Finalization:

Confirmed GuestIdentity as a 0..1 association to GuestRoomBooking. It is optional at the time of creation and only becomes mandatory at the Check-In workflow step.

Confirmed Fine as a 0..1 association, as it is only created if the "Damages Found?" decision node evaluates to true.
